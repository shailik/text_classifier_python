# Coronavirus Goes Viral: Quantifying the COVID-19 Misinformation Epidemic on Twitter
Journalists spend much of their time on Twitter and Tweetdeck, looking for relevant news stories, monitoring mis- and disinformation, or just gauging trending topics.

But Twitter’s interface and Tweetdeck provide only a shallow look at what is occurring on the platform. To better understand what is happening under the surface, such as whether a trending hashtag is being driven by inauthentic means, you need to tap into one of Twitter’s various application programming interfaces (APIs).

The many data fields provided through Twitter’s different APIs let journalists conduct much more meaningful analyses of Twitter activity and find exciting stories. These include identifying the crisscrossing of political rhetoric between countries or spotting how political activists from one country support presidential candidates in another.

With the current outbreak of hoaxes and rumors around the novel coronavirus Covid-19, understanding how specific hashtags, links, or claims are traveling on Twitter could prove crucial to limiting the spread of damaging misinformation.

This is our sincere attempt to predict misinformation in the Twitter dataset, using the classification approach! We hope you enjoy going through this!

Happy Coding!
